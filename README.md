# 🛡️ PhishGuard — Phishing URL Detection System

**Last Updated:** March 07, 2026

PhishGuard is a full-stack Flask web application that detects phishing URLs using a scikit-learn model. It provides an interactive web UI, user authentication, an admin panel, WHOIS enrichment, and persistent scan history.

---

**Quick highlights**: ML-powered URL analysis, real-time scanning, WHOIS enrichment, user dashboard with history, admin tools, and a responsive UI.

---

**Requirements**

- Python 3.8+
- pip
- See `requirements.txt` for exact pinned packages used by the project (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, Flask, etc.).

**Important environment variables** (optional)

- `SECRET_KEY` — Flask secret key (defaults to a development value if unset).
- `DATABASE_URL` or `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` — to use an external database instead of the local SQLite file.
- Vercel detection: the app auto-uses `/tmp/phishguard.db` when Vercel env vars are present.

---

## Installation (local)

1. Create and activate a virtual environment

Windows:

```powershell
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. (Optional) Train the model using a dataset placed in `dataset/`

```bash
python ml/train_model.py
```

The trained model will be written to `model/phishing_model.pkl`.

4. Start the app locally

```bash
python app.py
```

The development server runs on http://localhost:5000 by default. The ML model is loaded on the first detection request (lazy loading).

---

## Project layout

See [PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md](PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for a detailed file/folder map. Key folders:

- `app.py` — main Flask application and API endpoints (serves web UI + JSON API)
- `ml/` — feature extraction and training scripts (`features.py`, `train_model.py`)
- `model/` — trained model artifacts (`phishing_model.pkl`)
- `utils/` — `database.py`, `security.py` helpers
- `templates/`, `static/` — front-end templates and assets

---

## API & Usage

Basic endpoints (see `docs/API.md` for full reference):

- `POST /api/auth/register` — register user
- `GET /api/auth/verify` — verify token (requires auth)
- `POST /api/detect` — run phishing detection (requires auth), body: `{ "url": "https://example.com" }`

Responses include prediction (0 = legitimate, 1 = phishing), confidence, extracted features, WHOIS data, and HTTP resolution metadata.

---

## Notes

- The app creates an `instance/phishguard.db` SQLite file by default when run locally.
- Logs are written to `logs/app.log`.
- Training expects a CSV/XLSX file placed in `dataset/` containing a URL column and a label column.

Demo database (easy note): The built-in SQLite database is for demo and testing only. When you try the live demo (for example on Vercel) the database is temporary and changes will not be saved long-term — this means user accounts, edits, and scan history are shown only as a demonstration. To use the app with persistent storage or to manage users and edits safely, clone this repository and run it locally with a real database, or host a separate database server (Postgres, MySQL, Vercel Postgres, Supabase) and set `DATABASE_URL` or `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` before starting the app.

If you want, I can add step-by-step instructions to configure a managed database (Postgres/Supabase) and update the app to use it.

If you want, I can now update `docs/SETUP.md` and `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md` to match these exact commands and the pinned dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

The server starts at **http://localhost:5000**.

## 🎨 Design System

The CSS architecture uses a **global design token system** in `style.css` with CSS custom properties:

- **Theming**: `[data-theme="dark"]` / `[data-theme="light"]` with 30+ CSS variables
- **Components**: Glass panels, premium buttons, toggle switches, icon circles, badges
- **Shared**: Input groups, modals, toasts, tables, and icon buttons are in `style.css` for cross-page consistency
- **Page-specific**: Each page has its own CSS file for unique elements (orbs, activity streams, etc.)

## 🚢 Deployment & Database (Vercel)

This project uses SQLite for local development and an environment-aware path for deployments on Vercel.

- Behavior: on startup the app checks for common Vercel environment variables (`VERCEL`, `VERCEL_ENV`, `VERCEL_URL`). If present the app will use `/tmp/phishguard.db` as the SQLite file. Otherwise it creates and uses `instance/phishguard.db` in the project root.
- Location of logic: see `app.py` (the `_get_database_uri()` helper) and `utils/database.py` (`get_sqlite_path()` and `get_sqlite_connection()`).

Important caveats:
- Vercel's filesystem is ephemeral. Files written to `/tmp` are temporary and not suitable for persistent production storage. Data will be lost between deployments or cold starts.
- Multiple instances/functions do not share the same `/tmp` file. Concurrent or scaled deployments will have inconsistent local state.

Recommendations:
- For production use, switch to a managed database (Postgres, MySQL, Vercel Postgres, Supabase). You can then set a `DATABASE_URL` or `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable and update `app.py` to use it instead of SQLite. I can add this optional fallback if you'd like.
- The app also supports an explicit `DATABASE_URL` or `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI` environment variable. If set, the application will use that value preferentially. If initialization fails (bad URL or filesystem errors), the app will attempt to fall back to an in-memory SQLite database to keep the app running for testing.
- Use SQLite only for local development, demos, or small single-instance deployments.

Quick verification

- Run locally and confirm the DB file is created:

```powershell
python app.py
Get-ChildItem .\instance\phishguard.db
```

- Deploy to Vercel and verify logs contain the message `Using database at: /tmp/phishguard.db` (the app prints the chosen path at startup). Test endpoints to confirm DB writes succeed (remember data is ephemeral on Vercel).

Raw sqlite helper example (included): `utils/database.py` provides `sample_insert_raw_log()` and `get_sqlite_connection()` for quick manual inserts and tests.

### Vercel Deploy Checklist

Follow these minimal steps to deploy this app on Vercel (serverless):

- Ensure `vercel.json`, `api/index.py`, and `vercel-wsgi` are present (they are added in this repo).
- Add required environment variables in the Vercel project settings: at minimum `SECRET_KEY`. Add `DATABASE_URL` if you plan to use an external DB.
- Deploy from the repository root (the folder containing `vercel.json`) with:

```bash
vercel --prod
```

- After deployment, open `https://<your-deployment-url>/health` to confirm the app is running and DB selection shows `on_vercel: true` or indicates `/tmp` usage.
- Check Vercel function logs for startup errors and for the printed DB path.

Notes:
- Local `instance/` files are ignored on Vercel — use `/tmp` or `DATABASE_URL`.
- Prefer a managed DB (Postgres, Vercel Postgres, Supabase) for production; set `DATABASE_URL` accordingly.

## Deployment

This project is deployed on Vercel. The Flask app auto-detects Vercel environment variables and uses an ephemeral SQLite database at `/tmp/phishguard.db` when running on Vercel. For persistent storage in production, provide a managed database by setting `DATABASE_URL` or `SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI`.

Quick Vercel steps:

1. Install the Vercel CLI (optional):

```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. From the project root, login and deploy:

```bash
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

3. In the Vercel dashboard, add any environment variables you need (for example `SECRET_KEY`, or a managed `DATABASE_URL` to persist data).

Notes:
- Vercel's filesystem is ephemeral; do not rely on `instance/phishguard.db` for long-term storage on Vercel.
- The app contains logic to fall back to an in-memory DB if initialization fails; for production use a managed DB.
